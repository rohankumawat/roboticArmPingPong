<p>In this project, we built a robotic arm which can play table tennis in realtime. Our journey begins by solving the kinematics equation, finding the trajectory for each joint, 3D printing of robotic arm, assembling of parts, and tracking of the ball in realtime. It runs on Raspberry Pi 4B with Raspbian OS (based on Debian Buster)</p>
