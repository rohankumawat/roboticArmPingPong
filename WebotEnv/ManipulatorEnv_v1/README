This dir contains the webot model of a 5-DOF robotic arm. 
The joints can be controlled using the numpad keys
Each joint is a revolute joint.
Joint 1 -> Keys 1,2
Joint 2 -> Keys 3,4
Joint 3 -> Keys 5,6
Joint 4 -> Keys 7,8
Joint 5 -> Keys 9,0
This can be used to add constraints and explore the work envelope and the dimensions required for the manipulator.
